## Install
Copy and paste this into your terminal:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Saul-Dickson/dotfiles/master/install.sh\
>> install.sh; chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

This will download the installation file and make it executable. After that,
simply run this command for just the dotfiles.

`./install.sh -D`

#### Editor: [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

It's got a bunch of plugins, but I don't mind personally.

#### Shell: [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net)

Same thing here, bunch of plugins. I like how my shell is set up :).

#### Browser: [zen-browser](https://zen-browser.app/)

Still in alpha, this one. I like the UI so far, might change back to brave or
firefox at some point though.

#### Email Client: [mailspring](https://www.getmailspring.com/)

I'm not quite used to this atm, I like it so far, but it's still early days.

#### File Manager: [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)

Don't use it all that often, so my config is a bit barebones.

#### Pager: [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

Really like this one. Can be a bit of a pain in the arse at times though.

#### Ebook Reader: [epy](https://github.com/wustho/epy)

#### `find` Alternative: [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)

`fd` but written in rust. Don't particularly care about that last bit.

#### `ls` Alternative: [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa)

`ls` but pretty.

#### `grep` Alternative: [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

`grep` but fast, what more does it need to be?

#### `rm` Alternative: [trash-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash-cli)

`rm` but unnecessary. Might get rid of this at some point, but it's kinda
useful.
